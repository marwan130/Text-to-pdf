step 1: we initialize two computers as available
step 2: we start a simulation clock at time = 0
step 3: we generate the first task arrival time randomly using exponential distribution with average time of 3 seconds
step 4: repeat the following steps until simulation time exceeds n seconds
- if the clock reaches the task arrival time, generate a new task with a random service time between 1 and 5 seconds. if a computer is free we assign it that task, 
else enqeue the task in a fifo queue, then schedule the next task arrival
- update all the computers' remaining times
- if a computer finishes a task and the queue is not empty, we assign the next task in the queue to that computer
- increment the simulation clock
